Bugs:

1. When multiple values are enqueued the first value is replaced by the 2nd value that is enqueued.
This could be a bug in the enqueue function but could also be a bug in the peek function which selectively checks whether there are one or more values in the queue.
Such an implementation of peek would be tedious given the way the Queue class is defined so I am inclined to believe it is the former.

2. The destructor does not work properly. This can be seen in memory leaks when the program is run using Valgrind.
