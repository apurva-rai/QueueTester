Bugs:

1. When multiple values are enqueued the first value is replaced by the 2nd value that is enqueued and this results in one less value in the queue than the intended total.
This could be a bug in the enqueue function where it checks whether the front_pointer->next_Node() is nullptr meaning that there is only one value in the queue. If this is the case it replaces it instead of adding to the back of the queue.

2. The destructor does not work properly. This can be seen in memory leaks when the program is run using Valgrind.
